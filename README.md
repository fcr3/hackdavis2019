# Recipe - A HackDavis 2019 Project

## What's it about?
Recipe is an iOS app for scanning receipts. From those receipts, we can get tailored recipes that match your grocery bag and other things that you might have in your fridge, pantry, etc. The kicker is this: we care about healthy recipes and we especially care about healthy recipes for you. So you can choose to input data or your medical provider can give us data about you, but whatever the case may be, the app is there to serve you, literally.

## About us:
We are a hackdavis 2019 team, and this year, we were called to program for social good. Specifically, we were called to focus on three main topics: the environment, health, and education. Undoubetly, our app only hits on mainly one of these three topics, but eventually, we would like to expand this app to meet all three. It was actually born out of an idea to minimize trash. People often lose track of expiration dates and have to throw away an incredible amount of food. It just so happened, though, that we got the image processing and recipe generation down, but not the conservation, which is definitely integral to this app's mission. That being said, we still have a lot to do outside of a hackathon!

## Capabilities:
- Takes an image of a receipt or any document and extracts food item text
- Accessibility to thousands upon thousands of recipes, each having their nutritional analysis

## Todos:
- Health Record Accessbility and Security
- Trained ML models to parse strings for food key words
- MORE TIME!

## Technologies Used:
- Google Cloud Vision API
- Swift 4
- Alamofire with SwiftyJSON
- Firebase
- Edamame Recipe API
- SVProgressHUD
